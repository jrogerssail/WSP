		technically challenged, and he has been very patient teaching me what I need 
		to do. I know that when I call Steve with a problem, he will either talk to me 
		over the phone to fix the problem or come out and fix it himself. I know that
		if I call him, he usually comes out the same day. He is so kind and patient,
		and I do not have any desire to change my PC guy. Thanks a million for
		all your help!!!</p>

		anonymous I called PC on the Go over the weekend. I was unable to boot up into 
		the desktop. Steve attempted to help me fix the issue over the phone, at no 
		charge. This did not work, than he suggested to bring in the pc for him to look 
		at the situation for free and mentioned if it were going to be a quick fix he 
		would not charge me. I did bring the computer in and Steve worked on it for
		and determined a virus has damaged to many files and he had to reload the
		program. He gave me two choices and send the most expensive would be the
		best due to a virus, but he would try the inexpensive measures first. 
		After several hours Steve called me the computer was fix and at the 
		least expensive price. It is working great. Thanks Steve.</p>
