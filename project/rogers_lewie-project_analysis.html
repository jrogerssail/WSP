		<p>I am writing this e-mail to say thank you for your great customer service. I am in the process of setting up a new tank and have been purchasing many things from your web site. Your staff has been very helpful with many of my questions and concerns. I would also like to send out a special thank you and say that John has gone out of his way to help me, by calling me at home and letting me know that things are out of stock, and that I have placed double orders by mistake, and making sure that the credits are done quickly. There are not many company's these days that take the time to work with the customers as well as you have. I would like to say that all of my business and future orders will be done with Fish Tanks Direct because of your outstanding customer service.
		Sincerely,
		Jimmie Bacco

		<p>I just want to say thank you greatly for all of your assistance! I am highly impressed by your customer service focus, especially when you are the owner of the company.

If this tubing works as we hope, we do plan on ordering many more in the near future, as well, we also may need your custom tank building service.
